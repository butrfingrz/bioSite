            Allie loves to travel, especially anywhere with a beach, having been to several US states as well as
            Mexico, Puerto Rico, Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts, Saint Maarten, and the Philippines. Although travel
            has been a bit difficult lately, she still hopes to visit Scotland and Ireland to enjoy the scenery and she
            hopes to continue to find new beaches where she can do her absolute favorite activity, napping, especially
            in a hammock.

            One of Allies favorite activities is watching movies. She loves going to the theater to watch them on the
            big screen with a bag of popcorn. She is particularly fond of Disney movies. When she was younger, she loved
            to make people laugh by acting out her favorite parts in the voices of the characters.

            Allie loves all things to to with the ocean although she is particularly fond of sharks. Her dream is to be
            able to cage dive with great white sharks to see them up close. She says sharks are misunderstood and will
            tell anyone who will listen about her favorite shark fact which is that you are much more likely to drown
            than you are to get bitten by a shark.
