            People have been interested in astronomy since the beginning of time. <br> The Babylonians developed a
            calendar based on the sun and the phases of the Moon in the time period from about 1800 to 400 B.C and
            analyzed the variations in the velocity of the Sun and Moon numerically. Later, the Greeks took a
            geometrical approach to understand the celestial motions. <br> Since that time, we have been able to
            continue
            studying the vastness that is space. We have been able to learn things such as the fact that the Earth
            revolves around the sun at a speed of 67 thousand miles per hour and that the sun is moving around the
            Milky Way at a speed of 828 thousand km an hour and that the Milky Way is moving through space at a
            speed of 1.4 million miles an hour, and yet none of us are dizzy!

            The bow and arrow are believed to be one of the three most important inventions in human history. The
            bow and arrow made it possible for our ancestors to hunt bigger prey from a safer distance. It allowed
            humans to consume a more protein rich diet and gave them more raw materials like bone for tools and hide
            for warm clothing. There have been cave paintings that date as far back as twelve thousand years ago
            that depict man hunting with a bow and arrow. Today, archery has evolved as a tool for survival to one
            that is also used for sport. Archery is a unique and rewarding challenge requiring that archers have
            endurance and strength to perform well.
