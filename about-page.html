        <h2>Meet Allie!</h2>
        <p>Allie is a medical assistant working toward her Associates degree in Psychology. She loves learning about
            Psychology and her goal is to become a therapist. When sheâ€™s not doing school or working, you might find
            her that the Archery or Shooting range, going to the theater to kick back and watch a movie on the big
            screen, or studying up on all things related to space and oceans. In fact, her dream job would be a
            marine biologist because she is a shark enthusiast.
            <br>Allie also likes to travel, especially anywhere with a beach, having been to several US states as
            well as Mexico, Puerto Rico, Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts, Saint Maarten, and the Philippines.
            Although travel has been a bit difficult lately, she still hopes to visit Scotland and Ireland to enjoy
            the scenery and she hopes to continue to find new beaches where she can do her absolute favorite
            activity, napping, especially in a hammock.
            <br>If you were to ask her how she would describe herself, she would say that she is sarcastic,
            personable, tough, loyal, and original. If you ask anyone who knows her, they will agree but add that
            although she seems to have a tough exterior, she is a very kind and generous person. When asked what she
            would do with a million dollars, the first thing that came to her mind was taking care of her family;
            paying off their debts and moving them across the country to be closer. She also added later that she
            would use the rest of the money to travel more.
